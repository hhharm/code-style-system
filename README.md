# code-style-system
2020 Yandex Frontend School, task #1 - implement code style system

What I  used:
- html5 boilerplate to start with, because it created folder structure, basic files 
- scss because it's awesome for BEM (nesting, mixins)
- css variables. Because they are sweet :3
- autoprefixer and nanocss from postcss

༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ tests do not pass but it looks different and ok and pixel perfect on my computer
