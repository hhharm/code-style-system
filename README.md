# code-style-system
2020 Y@nde}{ Frontend School, task #1 - implement code style system

What I  used:
- html5 boilerplate to start with, because it created folder structure, basic files 
- scss because it's awesome for BEM (nesting, mixins)
- css variables. Because they are sweet :3
- autoprefixer for cross browser: https://autoprefixer.github.io/ru/
- minimizer for smaller sime: https://csscompressor.com/
